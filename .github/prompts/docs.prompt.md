# Victoria 3 Scripting Docs Prompt

This file is intended as a reference for AI agents and developers working on the Victoria3Timeline mod. It summarizes the key scripting documentation generated by the mod, as found in the `docs/` folder:

- `custom_localization.log`: Custom localization keys and usage.
- `effects.log`: All custom and vanilla effect blocks, with supported scopes and usage.
- `event_targets.log`: Event target documentation, including input/output scopes.
- `modifiers.log`: Modifier types, masks, and descriptions.
- `on_actions.log`: On action hooks, expected scopes, and usage.
- `triggers.log`: All custom and vanilla triggers, with supported scopes and usage.

For detailed scripting reference, always consult the latest files in the `docs/` folder. These are auto-generated and reflect the current state of the mod's scripting interface.

Example usage for AI agents:
- When generating new effects, check `effects.log` for existing patterns and supported scopes.
- For new triggers, consult `triggers.log` to avoid duplication and ensure correct usage.
- When adding new on_actions, review `on_actions.log` for available hooks and required structure.

If you need to update or regenerate this documentation, follow the mod's developer workflow for documentation generation (see main copilot instructions).
